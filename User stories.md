# User Stories for Bettors

**1. Registration/ Sign Up:** As a new bettor, I want to create my account by connecting to Solana wallets so that I can place bets.
- Click on the SignUp button
- A popup asks you to connect your wallet -> Select your preferred wallet -> Enter the password.

**2. Transfer SOL to platform wallet:** As a bettor, I want to transfer SOLs that I want to risk on bets to my platform wallet so that I can place bets.
- Click on the "My Wallet" button on the app.
- Click on "Add SOL" -> Confirm the amount of SOL you want to transfer -> Click Ok -> Confirmation popup displaying successful transfer.

**3. Navigation**
1. As a bettor, I want to see the list of active events/games I can place bets on. I should be able to filter the events based on leagues or formats.
2. As a bettor, I want to see the list of game cards to display the following:
   - Name of the league
   - Team A vs Team B
   - Question related to the game on which the user decides to place a bet
   - Two buttons with the probable answers to the question and the betting price for each answer. The user will place a bet on one of the answers to go in their favor in the future.
3. [Optional] As a bettor, I should be able to view the number of bets on a particular option, so that I can understand the user sentiment to make a correct decision.

**4. Placing Bets and after**
1. As a bettor, I want to place a bet on an active event/ game. After I place and the game is ongoing, I expect to see:
   - Increase or decrease in my earnings based on the win prediction and situation in the game.
2. As a bettor, there are two ways to exit the bet:
   - I want to be able to exit my trades at any moment and the difference is added to my platform wallet (if I win).
   - or, once the game ends my bet ends automatically and I am rewarded if I win.

# User stories for Admin
1. As an admin, I should be able to CRUD bids, and assign prices to each betting option.
2. As an admin, I should be able to manage users.
